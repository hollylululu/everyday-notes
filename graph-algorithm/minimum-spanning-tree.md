# Minimum Spanning Tree
## Problem Definition
Given a directed weighted graph G(V,E), a minimum spanning tree (MST) is a path that connects all vertices
in G while having minimum weight.  
## Three properties of MST
## Three algorithms
There are three widely known algorithms for the MST problem. They all utilize the cut property and keep adding
edges to the resulting graph, but in different orders. The three algorithms have similar runtime. There also exist
faster algorithms, but with more sophisticated data structures and implementations.
### Kruskal Algorithm
### PDJ Algorithm
### Boruvka's Algorithm
