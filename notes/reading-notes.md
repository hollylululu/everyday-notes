### The Sense of Style

I started reading Steven Pinker's _The Sense of Style_. It is a casual writing guide from a cognitive scientist \(as well as a linguist\)'s perspective. Pinker was able to use his domain knowledge to make sense of not only how we should write, but also why we should write in particular ways. It is so far a very enjoyable read - he blended some interesting psychology, cognitive science and linguistics knowledge in his writing, as he did in his earlier books. 

> Good writing starts strong. Not with a cliche..., not with a banality, ..., but with a contentful observation that provokes curiosity.

This is so true. I've always been attracted by articles and books that started strong. But it is hard to write in this way. Not because I don't know how to, but because I don't know if I am qualified to put a strong statement. But, if I can't be confident about what I'll be writing, who else can? I'll need to take this as my future writing rule \#1 - write strong & be confident.
