# Reading Notes

### The Sense of Style

I started reading Steven Pinker's _The Sense of Style_. 

> Good writing starts strong. Not with a cliche..., not with a banality, ..., but with a contentful observation that provokes curiosity.

This is so true. I've always been attracted by articles and books that started strong. But it is hard to write in this way. Not because I don't know how to, but because I don't know if I am qualified to put a strong statement. But, if I can't be confident about what I'll be writing, who else can? I'll need to take this as my future writing rule \#1 - write strong & be confident.
