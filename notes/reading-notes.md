### The Sense of Style

I started reading Steven Pinker's _The Sense of Style_. It is a casual writing guide from a cognitive scientist \(as well as a linguist\)'s perspective. Pinker was able to use his domain knowledge to make sense of not only how we should write, but also why we should write in particular ways. It is so far a very enjoyable read - he blended some interesting psychology, cognitive science and linguistics knowledge in his writing, as he did in his earlier books. 

> Good writing starts strong. Not with a cliche..., not with a banality, ..., but with a contentful observation that provokes curiosity.

This is so true. I've always been attracted by articles and books that started strong. But it is hard to write in this way. Not because I don't know how to, but because I don't know if I am qualified to put a strong statement. But, if I can't be confident about what I'll be writing, who else can? I'll need to take this as my future writing rule \#1 - write strong & be confident. 

### Evicted 

I began reading ethnography books this year, and have read a few that changed my understanding of this field. As a student mainly studying and performing quantitative studies, I have many questions and doubts of qualitative studies, especially ethnography. Would it be too personal and subjective? How generalizable is it? Is it really worth the time \(considering most ethnography studies take around a year or even more\) and the cost? Questions like these are not uncommon for people like me who are used to deal with numbers but not people. In this review, I am noting down my thoughts and take-aways of this book both regarding its content and its methods as an ethnography study.

Evicted is the winner of Pulitzer Non-fiction in 2017. However, this is not how I heard about it first. I was browsing Zhihu \(Chinese Quora\) and encountered a post where this book has been mentioned. It was posted by a sociology graduate student who raised some questions about this book - "They are homeless because they bought lobsters using their food stamps. Who to blame?", "The author built his career on those people's miseries.", etc. I was curious and started reading this book.

The book was based on the author, Matthew Desmond's experience living with people who struggled to keep a roof over their heads in Milwaukee from May 2008 to Dec 2009. He has lived in trailers and talked to landlords and people who lived there. From these experience he had first-hand information of what the living situations were like for people who lived on food stamps and housing assistances. He also found that public statistics regarding situations like these were not sufficient and reliable. Therefore, he designed his own surveys to include quantitative information for the study. 

Books about poverty are not rare. I've read Hillbilly Elegy last year, which is more of a personal history. Evicted is different, as Matthew illustrated. He argued that poverty is not a noun, it is a verb, an action. Especially housing and renting, it is never about one group of people. There are multiple groups of people and organizations and policies that are so intertwined that without any of them, the picture is not complete. As Matthew wrote - _"Poverty was a relationship, I thought, involving poor and rich people alike. To understand poverty, I needed to understand that relationship. This sent me searching for a process that bound poor and rich people together in mutual dependence and struggle. Eviction was such a process."_  He talked to landlords \(Sherrena and Quentin\), single moms with kids \(Arleen, etc\), people with disabilities \(Lamar\) and people whose life was out of track due to drugs \(Scott, etc\). From them, Matthew put together different pieces of the story - why keeping a roof over people's head, especially for these groups of people, is so hard. There are things you will never know unless you've been one of them. 

I was able to find an answer to the graduate student's question regarding "trading food stamps for lobsters". 

The notes provided references to many relevant papers and books regarding poverty, housing situations and ethnography studies. I compiled a list for my future reading.
